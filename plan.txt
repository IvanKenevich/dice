                A GAME
Server serves 2 client that throw 5 dice.

All the logic happens on the server. It tells each client what it's supposed to be doing
and then the client performs these operations (like listening for mouse events) and sends
the result back to the server

Each client will have a simple GUI that can control the game
Maybe make a GUI for the server just for fun?
