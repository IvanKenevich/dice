                A GAME
Server serves 2 clientold that throw 5 dice.

All the logic happens on the serverold. It tells each clientold what it's supposed to be doing
and then the clientold performs these operations (like listening for mouse events) and sends
the result back to the serverold

Each clientold will have a simple GUI that can control the game
Maybe make a GUI for the serverold just for fun?
